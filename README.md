My good friend Yuda is getting married.
We arranged a Bachelor party at a big villa for 2 days.
Unfortunately, in this Villa we have only 3 double-sized beds and the rest are couches, tables, chairs etc.
We are 12 people.
So we wanted everyone to have an equal chance sleeping on the double-sized bed.
So I created this project lol.
